## Background

In this exercise you will create an ASCII rendering of the
[Rule 110](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_110)
[Elementary Cellular
Automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_cellular_automaton)
(CA). Not as scary as it sounds, and a nice simple Rust
thing to play with.


A CA starts with a random row of bits. We will represent 1
bits with `*` and 0 bits with `.`. Our starting row will
specifically be this 8-bit position for now.

    *.*.**..

To produce the next row, take bits three at a time,
"wrapping around" if a boundary is hit (row 7 is next to row
0 and so forth).  A group of three
bits in row *n* will determine the center bit position in
row *n + 1* according to Rule 110:

    111 → 0
    110 → 1
    101 → 1
    100 → 0
    011 → 1
    010 → 1
    001 → 1
    000 → 0

So for our start, the first two rows will be

    *.*..*..
    ***.**.*

(Notice the wraparound at the beginning and end.)

## The Program

Write a program that prints ten rows starting with the two
given.

## Hints

* You could use either `u8` or `[bool; 8]` to represent a
  row.  The second thing is easier, so I'll assume that.

* If you print out as you go, you only need to keep track of
  two rows: the current row and the next row.

* Arrays in Rust are first-class: you can copy-assign them,
  pass them as function arguments, etc.

* You should probably write a function `rule110()` with a
  signature something like
  ```rust
  fn rule110(bits: [bool; 3]) -> bool {
      todo!()
  }
  ```
  in the array case, or 
  ```rust
  fn rule110(bits: u8) -> u8 {
      todo!()
  }
  ```
  in the bit case. The `match` statement is your friend
  here.

  You may want other functions as well.

* You can't index a string in Rust, because UTF-8 encoded
  Unicode code points are variable-width. `s.chars()` is an
  iterator over the characters of a string.

* Do *not* be afraid to ask for help. This is the hardest
  assignment, probably, because things are new.


## Challenges

*(Challenges are ***not*** required, but give a chance to do
something extra. Turn them in and write them up in the README.)*

* Make your program take a command-line argument for the
  starting row. You may limit the length of the argument.
  If no argument is given, use the default for the program.

  This code

  ```rust
  let arg = std::env::args().nth(1);
  ```

  will assign `arg` either `Some(String)` or `None`
  depending on whether an argument is given.

* Time your program. See how fast you can make it
  go. Compare performance with a C or C++ implementation.
  You will probably have to modify the program to print *a
  lot* more rows: maybe some number given by a command-line
  argument.

## Requirements

* You must create a `README.md`. This file will have
  * Your authorship information.
  * A description of the program: what it does.
  * How to build and run the program.
  * Comments on any issues you encountered,
  * Anything else a reader might find useful.

* Your crate must be adequately documented with Rustdoc
  comments for each top-level datatype, function and
  method.

* Your crate must build with current `stable` Rust.

* Your crates should contain adequate tests (implemented
  using `#[test]` unit-testing) and assertions
  (implemented using `assert!()` and related macros) for
  you to be comfortable that everything is working
  correctly. 
  
  There is no minimum amount of testing required, but good
  tests can help you turn in a working program.

* Your code must be formatted according to the official Rust
  formatting style --- use `cargo fmt` to reformat your code in-place.

* Your code must produce no warnings.

  * The compiler must produce no warnings.

  * `cargo clippy` must produce no warnings.

  * Do not disable warnings except in the most unusual
    circumstances: fix them instead.

## Submission

Please submit a ZIP archive containing:

*   Your `Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock`.

*   Your `src/main.rs`.

*   Any other source or other text files that are necessary/useful.

*   The `README.md` file in Markdown format described above.

*   *Nothing else.* Not your git repo. None of the funny Mac garbage
    files. Not your `target/` directory.

Name your ZIP archive `rule-110.zip` (exactly that, in lowercase).
